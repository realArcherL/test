3. My possible guess is to upload a reverse shell and exploit the website. trying Stored XSS first in the bug submission.
4. For sure an XSS, no file upload functionality.
5. nodejs as the backend, Express library. need to bypass the XSS filter. (HASH in the cookie, no identifiable type).
6. Different Cookie generation on different account login. **New ID** -> k@gmail.com Pass: Pass, cookie value: f6bbb44d-8a2f-4ce6-9dd3-027a5b7ff97c
can be like this:

Googled something like XSS on react, this comes up.
